<!-- Different Types of Trees -->

1. B-tree
2. Heaps
3. Binary Trees
4. Hashtables
5. Binary Search Tees (A kind of Binary Trees) i.e Data is kept in a particular order which means every node to the right is greater than the root node and the ones on the left is less than the root node

<!-- Binary Search Trees -->

1. Every parent node has at most two children
2. Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
3. Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent
